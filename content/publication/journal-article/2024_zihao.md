## Abstract

**Summary** A knowledge gap exists in associating later life’s osteoporotic fracture and middle adulthood’s BMI trajectories.
We observed an association showing those transitioning from overweight to normal weight face a higher fracture risk in late
adulthood, emphasizing the potential benefts of maintaining a stable BMI to reduce late-life fractures.
**Purpose** Numerous studies on the relationship between obesity and fractures have relied on body mass index (BMI) at a
single time point, yielding inconclusive results. This study investigated the association of BMI trajectories over middle
adulthood with fracture risk in late adulthood.
**Methods** This prospective cohort study analyzed 1772 qualifed participants from the Framingham Original Cohort Study,
with 292 (16.5%) incident fractures during an average of 17.1-year follow-up. We constructed BMI trajectories of age
35–64 years based on latent class mixed modeling and explored their association with the risk of fracture after 65 years
using the Cox regression.
**Results** The result showed that compared to the BMI trajectory Group 4 (normal to slightly overweight; see “Methods” for
detailed description), Group 1 (overweight declined to normal weight) had a higher all-fracture risk after age 65 (hazard
ratio [HR], 2.22, 95% CI, 1.13–4.39). The secondary analysis focusing on lower extremity fractures (pelvis, hip, leg, and
foot) showed a similar association pattern.
**Conclusions** This study suggested that people whose BMI slightly increased from normal weight to low-level overweight
during 30 years of middle adulthood confer a signifcantly lower risk of fracture in later life than those whose BMI declined
from overweight to normal weight. This result implies the potentially benefcial efects of avoiding weight loss to normal
weight during middle adulthood for overweight persons, with reduced fracture risk in late life.
